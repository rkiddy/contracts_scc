        The data is stored in a MySQL database with
        <a href="https://opencalaccess.org/scc_contracts/schema.html">this schema</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Contract Documents</h2>
    <p>
        Ideally, the County would make the
        <a href="https://opencalaccess.org/data/contracts/scc/contracts_docs">contract documents</a>
        themselves available to the public, but they do not. There is a contract "owner"
        within the Procurement Department who might answer questions, but I have not
        found a question that will not be answered with another question. It seems that
        one must file a California Public Records Act request in order to see a contract.
        It is, though, easy to do this. Send an email to cpra@prc.sccgov.org and specify
        a contract or contracts and they will send you electronic copies, after waiting
        the allowed time period. I have linked in the contract texts that I have received
        above. Click on the Contract ID links to see the details for the contract, which
        will incude the contract documents. If anyone thinks that other contracts should
        be looked at, please let me know and they can be requested.
    </p>
    <h2>Importing</h2>
    <p>
        The Procurement Office published two monthly reports which describe the active
        contracts. They publish these on an "Active Contracts" page. The reports may or
        may not be published every month. Some have been missed, perhaps because of
        staff shortages associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. The reports for a given
        month seem to come out between 6 or 7 and 9 weeks after the end of the month.
    </p>
    <p>
        The import scripts do some data correcting, but it is not much. There are many
        vendor names, for example, which are obviously incomplete. As I am able, I find
        the proper names for these vendors and I display these vendors with their proper
        names. I do not replace the bad names in the original data. Instead I add a row
        to a table which joins with the <code>vendors</code> table to provide the correction.
        I try to make all corrections by adding correct data, but not by removing the original
        data. If I replaced these original values, I would be breaking the connection
        between my data and the data published by the Procurement Office. If I make fixes,
        I always want these to verifiable now and in the future against the Procurement
        Office data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ultimately, the accuracy of this data cannot be completely guaranteed. The data
        is published by the Procurement Office as PDF files and the process of reading
        data out of PDF files is inherently error-prone. Indeed, one does not use PDFs
        if one wants to encourage re-use of the data being published. A PDF is for making
        the data look good and not much else.
    </p>
    <h2>Contract-Months</h2>
    <p>
        The main <code>contracts</code> table contains the expected information about a
        contract but it also points to the month in which a contract appeared. This
        causes some duplication. For example, if a contract ran from January 1, 2021 to May
        31, 2022 and if every month had a exported PO report, then there would be 17 rows
        in the contracts table for this contract. If the contract was written and never
        changed, then all 17 rows would be exactly the same. Many contracts, though, do
        change and I am keeping track of when those changes appear in the exported data.
    </p>
    <p>
        At any one time, the contracts application is showing data relevant to the last
        month for which data is available. There may be delays in my processing this data.
        For example, as of now (2022-09-11), the application shows data for June of 2022.
        Data for July of 2022 has become available sometime in the last week, but that data
        has not yet been imported.
    </p>
    <h2>Contract Total Values vs Year Values</h2>
    <p>
        In most places in the contracts application, one will see both the total value
        of a contract or the year value of a contract. At some points, only one of these
        will be displayed. What do these mean?
    </p>
    <p>
        Most contracts cover multiple years. The only pieces of information about this
        being exported are the "Effective Date", the "Expiration Date", and the "Contract
        Value" of the contract. So, I am doing what I can. To determine the "year value"
        for a contract for a particular year, I divide the start and stop dates of the
        contract into their years and apportion the total contract to each year. For
        example, if a contract is due to pay $2 million and its effective date was
        2021-04-01 and its expiration date was 2022-03-31. So, the the portion of the
        contract period in 2020 covered 9 months, the period covered in 2021 was 12 months
        and the period covered in 2022 was 3 months. So, the year values would be:
<pre>
total value      $ 2,000,000.00    covers 2020-04-01 to 2022-03-31
------------------------------------------------------------------
2020 value           750,000.00    covers 2020-04-01 to 2020-12-31
2021 value         1,000,000.00    covers 2021-01-01 to 2021-12-31
2022 value           250,000.00    covers 2022-01-01 to 2022-03-31</pre>
        The calculations are actually based precisely on the number of days of the contract
        period covered in each year, but this example hopefully makes clear how the contract
        value is divided up for reporting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that my "year value" calculation has absolutely nothing to do with when the
        County is actually spending money on a contract. I am sure that a check register
        somewhere keeps track of precisely when checks are being sent out for these contracts.
        Is there some way that the County links these payments to the contract behind them
        to enable oversight? One would hope so, but I am not sure how or if the public can
        get the specific information about these payments from the contract information.
    </p>
    <h2>Contract ID Numbers</h2>
    <p>
        There are three kinds of ID numbers for contracts. The reasons for this have to do
        with what system was being used to track a contract when it was first seen. In the
        monthly "Contracts Report", these IDs appear under the "Contract ID Ariba" and "PO ID)"
        heading. In the "SA BC Report", the ID appears under the "Contract ID (PO ID)" heading.
        In how many contracts are which IDs defined? The data below shows the usage
        of these IDs in the data for June of 2022.
    <p>
    <pre>
    count    contract_id   ariba_id     sap_id
    1327      NON_NULL      NULL         NULL
     127      NULL          NON_NULL     NON_NULL
     496      NULL          NON_NULL     NULL
     271      NULL          NULL         NON_NULL</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    What do these ID numbers really mean? I am not curious about this. I have observed
    that a "contract_id, ariba_id, sap_id" triplet uniquely identifes a contract and
    that is enough.
