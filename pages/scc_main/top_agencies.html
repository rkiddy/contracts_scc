<p>* Note that a contract may connect to more than one agency. Therefore a list of contracts
  grouped by agencies and listing the contracts' total values will include some duplication of
  contracts. The "<a href="/cgi-bin/WebObjects/app.woa/1/wo/skqda8Ymhn92e8esyG8FU0/0.23">All Contracts</a>&quot;
  link, not grouped, has no duplicate data.
