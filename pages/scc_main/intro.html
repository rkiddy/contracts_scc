<h3>Santa Clara County Active Contracts</h3>
<p>This data comes from the two 'Active Contracts' reports created by the Procurement
    department every (or almost every) month. The accuracy of this data cannot be guaranteed because
    the Procurement department publishes these reports as PDF files and interpreting the data inside
    PDF files can be error-prone and cannot be guaranteed to be correct. If you have any questions
    about this data, please verify the contract information with the source PDF files, linked below.</p>
