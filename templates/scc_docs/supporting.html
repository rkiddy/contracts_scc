        These are all of the SCC contracts for which we have supporting documents.
        One can see the identifying information on the two PDF files found on the
        Procurement Department's Active Contracts page, but the only way to get
        more information about any contract is to file a California Public Records
        Act request with the Department. One can do this by sending an email to
        cpra@prc.sccgov.org. I have been successful in my requests by including the
        Vendor Name, Contract Value, Effective and Expiry Dates, and whichever of
        the Ariba ID, the Contract ID, and the SAP ID are defined for the contract.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Months" column below lists the first and last time that the contract
        appeared in the reports exported from the Procurement Department. This
        page, unlike most others found here, includes contracts that are no longer
        current and which will not be findable in the Procurement Department
        reports.
